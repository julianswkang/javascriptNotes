HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the raw data that a webpage is built of -- text, links, cards, lists, buttons. Provides basic structure for the web page design and layout 
CSS adds style, position to those plain elements generated by HTML -- provides visual appeal and presentation of the HTML elements to the webpage 
Javascript increases interactivity and handles complex functions/features 

HTML&CSS are not programming languages - there is no logic vs. Javascript, which is used to make webpages do things and make it interactive for users 

Almost all elements on HTML page are pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags 
Opening tags tell the browser that it is the start of an HTML element (ex <p>), closing tags signal end of element (ex. </p>)
There are some HTML elementts that do NOT have a closing tag, known as empty elements -- do not wrap any content 
There is content between the opening and closing tags 


Boiler plate for html pages:
<!DOCTYPE html> //tells the browser which version of HTML this is (HTML5)
<html lang="en"> //<html> element = root element of the document, lang = language of text content
  <head> //put meta-information ABOUT our webpages
    <title>My First Webpage</title> //title element is for the webpage browser tab 
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> //meta charset ensures that the webpage will display special characters/symbols correctly
  </head>

  <body> //body is where all of the content that will be displayed to users will go
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

Shortcut in VScode for boiler plate on HTML file is "!" on the first line of code
Different charsets to use 
    -ASCII -- most basic, but not as popular.. not enough characters 
    -UTF-8 -- industry standard, used for consistency of character encoding 

--Paragraphs
Each time you want to create a paragraph in html, you must use the paragraph element <p></p>

--Headings
There are 6 different levels of headings from <h1> to <h6> (largest to smallest)

--strong
<strong> element makes text bold 

--em ("emphasis")
<em> makes the element italic 

When nesting elements, we create a parent-child relationship between them. To represent this, should indent the child elements 
Elements at the same level of nesting are considered to be siblings 

--Writing comments:
<!-- Comment goes here -->

--Creating lists:
Unordered lists (bullet points) use the <ul></ul> tags
    each item within the list item is created using the element <li></li>
Ordered lists (numbered) use the <ol></ol> tags
    each item also created with <li></li>

--Links and images 
To create a link in HTML, use the anchor element with <a></a> tag
Will need an associated HTML attribute, which always goes in the element's opening tag 
Attrivutes give additional information to an HTML element
In this case, will need to add an href (hyperlink reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag 
ex. <a href="https://www.google.com">click me</a>
If the href attribute is present, the browser will give the text a blue color and underline to signify that it is a link 

2 kinds of links: absolute vs relative links 
Absolute links = links to other websites on the internet, as seen above
Relative links = links within our own website -- do not include domain name since it is another page on the same site 
    --only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on 
    ex. <a href="about.html>About</a>
    This will send you to the About page on your web site. the about.html should be in the same directory
    Use the "./" prior to the file name if within the same "level" directory 
    To access the parent "above level" directory, use "../" prior to the file name 

Images 
To display an image in HTML, we use the <img> element -- does not use a closing tag 
Instead of using opening/closing tags, will embed an image into the page using an src attribute, tells the browser where the image file is located 
You can create a new sub directory in the main directory/project 
    if the target image (dog.jpg) is in the images directory, can use: <img src="images/dog.jpg">
Besides the src attribute, should also use an alt attribute --> will be used in place of image if cannot be loaded and also used with screen readers to describe the image 
    ex. <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo">
    ex. <img src="images/dog.jpg" alt="Picture of black pug">
4 different image formats you can use on the web
1. jpg - good for handling large color palettes without crazy file sizes **good for photos**
2. gif - good for simple animations
3. png - great for anything that is not a photo or animated **good for diagrams/icons**
4. svg - can scale up or down to ANY dimension without loss of quality **should use whenever possible!**
